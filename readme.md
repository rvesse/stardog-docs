Stardog Documentation
=====================

We write Stardog docs in markdown:

* Start a new chapter by copying an existing chapter and tweaking it.
* Pick an Alan Perlis quote carefully! :>
* Be aware of the <t>something</t> macros we use... see docpad.coffee 

If you're outside our org and are forking this repo to donate improvements to the Stardog docs,
first: thanks! 

Second: be aware of the above and make sure to ask questions if you need help.

Third: be aware of LICENSE.
