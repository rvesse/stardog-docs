  <p>In this chapter we describe <a href="#reasoning">how to use Stardog's reasoning capabilities</a>; we also address some <a href="#trouble">common problems</a> and <a href="#issues">known issues</a>. We also describe <a href="#approach">Stardog's approach to query answering</a> in some detail, as well as a set of <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> that contribute to efficient query answering. If you are not familiar with the terminology, you can peruse the section on <a href="#terminology">terminology</a>.</p>

<p>Stardog reasoning is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-sparql11-entailment-20100126/#id45013">OWL 2 Direct Semantics Entailment Regime</a>. Stardog performs reasoning in a very lazy and late-binding fashion: it does not materialize inferences; but, rather, reasoning is performed at query time according to a given reasoning level. This allows for maximum flexibility while maintaining excellent performance and scalability.</p>

<p>Stardog supports several reasoning levels; the reasoning level determines the kinds of inference rules or axioms that are to be considered during query evaluation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>NONE</b>. No axioms are considered.</li>
  <li><b>RDFS</b>. For the OWL 2 axioms allowed in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF schema</a> (mainly subclasses, subproperties, domain, and ranges).</li>
  <li><b>QL</b>. For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_QL">OWL 2 QL</a> axioms.</li>
  <li><b>RL</b>. For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_RL">OWL 2 RL</a> axioms.</li>
  <li><b>EL</b>. For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_EL">OWL 2 EL</a> axioms.</li>
  <li><b>DL</b>. For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/">OWL 2 DL</a> axioms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stardog also supports <a href="#swrl">user-defined rule reasoning</a> (using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a> syntax and bultins).<n>SWRL rules are taken into account for reasoning for all reasoning levels except <b>NONE</b>.</n></p>

</section>

<section id="reasoning"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Using Reasoning</h1></header>

<p>In order to perform query evaluation with reasoning, Stardog requires a schema (sometimes called a "TBox") to be present in the database. Since schemas are serialized as RDF, they are loaded into a Stardog database in the same way that any RDF is loaded into a Stardog database. Also, note that, since it is just more RDF triples, the schema may change as needed: it is neither fixed nor compiled in any special way.</p>

<a id="tbox_extraction"></a><p>The schema may reside in the default graph, in a specific named graph, or in a collection of graphs. You can tell Stardog where the schema is by setting the <code>reasoning.schema.graphs</code> property to one or more named graph URIs. If we want the default graph to be considered part of the schema, then we can use the special built-in URI <code>tag:stardog:api:context:default</code>. If we want to use all named graphs (that is, to tell Stardog to look for the schema in every named graph), we can use <code>tag:stardog:api:context:all</code>. The default value for this property is to use the default graph only.</p>

<h2>Query Answering</h2>

<p>All of Stardog's interfaces (API, network, and command-line as of @@VERSION@@) support reasoning during query evaluation.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>

<p>In order to evaluate queries in Stardog using reasoning via the command line, a specific reasoning level must be specified in the <a href="../admin/">connection string</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./stardog query "myDB;reasoning=QL" "SELECT ?s { ?s a :C } LIMIT 10"</code></pre>

<h3>HTTP</h3>

<p>For HTTP, the reasoning level is specified with the other connection parameters in the request header <tt>SD-Connection-String</tt>:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -u admin:admin -X GET -H "SD-Connection-String: reasoning=QL" \
  "http://localhost:5822/myDB/query?query=..."</code></pre>

<h2>ReasoningConnection API</h2>

<p>In order to use the ReasoningConnection API one needs to specify a reasoning level. See the <a href="../java/">Java Programming</a> chapter for details on specifying the reasoning level programmatically.</p>

<p>Currently, the API has two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>isConsistent(), which can be used to check if the current KB is consistent with respect to the reasoning level.</li>
<li>isSatisfiable(URI theURIClass), which can be used to check if the given class if satisfiable with respect to the current KB and reasoning level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explaining Reasoning Results</h2>
   
<p>Stardog can be used to check if the current KB logically entails a set of triples; moreover, Stardog can explain why this is so. An explanation of an inference is the minimum set of statements explicitly stored in the database that together justify or warrant the inference. Explanations are useful for debugging and understanding, especially when large number of statements interact with each other to infer new statements.</p>

<p>Explanations can be retrieved using the CLI command <tt>explain inference</tt> by providing an input file that contains the inferences to be explained:</p>
  
  <pre><code>$ stardog reasoning explain "myDB;reasoning=EL" inference_to_explain.ttl </code></pre>
  
<p>The output is displayed in a concise syntax designed to be legible; but it can be rendered
  in any one of the supported RDF syntaxes if desired. Explanations are also accessible through the 
  <a href="../network/#extended-http">extended HTTP protocol</a> and SNARL API. See the examples included in 
  the distribution for more details about retrieving explanations programmatically.</p>
  
  <p>Note that there is probably more than one explanation for an inference, but Stardog returns only a single
  explanation. We plan to compute multiple explanations in a future version.</p>

<section id="trouble"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Not Getting Expected Answers?</h1></header>

<p>Here's a few things that you might want to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do you know what to expect?</b> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/">OWL 2 primer</a> is always a good place to start.</li>
<li><b>Is the schema where you think it is?</b> Stardog might be extracting the wrong schema. You have to tell Stardog where to find the schema. See <a href="#tbox_extraction">Schema Extraction</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Are you using the right reasoning level?</b> Perhaps some of the modeling constructs (a.k.a. axioms) in your database are being ignored. You can find out which axioms are being ignored due to the reasoning level used by simply including the following line in the logging.properties file in <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt>:
<pre><code>com.clarkparsia.blackout.level = ALL</code></pre>
</li>
<li><b>Are you using DL?</b> Stardog supports schema-only reasoning for OWL 2 DL, which effectively means that only TBox queries&mdash;queries that contain <a href="#query_types">TBox BGPs</a> only&mdash;will return complete query results.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="issues"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Known Issues</h1></header>

  <p>Stardog <b>@@VERSION@@</b> does not</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Follow ontology <code>owl:imports</code> statements automatically; any imported OWL ontologies that are required for reasoning must be loaded into a Stardog database in the normal way.</li>
  <li>Handle recursive queries. If recursion is necessary to answer the query with respect to the schema, results will be sound (no wrong answers) but potentially incomplete (some correct answers not returned) with respect to the requested reasoning type.</li>
  <li>Perform equality reasoning. Only <i>explicit</i> <code>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>owl:differentFrom</code> data assertions will be taken into account for query answering.</li>
  <li>Perform datatype reasoning and user-defined datatypes.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section id="swrl"><header><h1 id='chapter'>User-defined Rule Reasoning</h1></header>

<p>Many reasoning problems may be solved with OWL's axiom-based approach; but, of course, not all reasoning problems are amenable to this approach. A user-defined rules approach complements the OWL axiom-based approach nicely and increases the expressive power of a reasoning system from the user's point of view. Many RDF databases support user-defined rules only. Stardog is one of the only RDF databases that comprehensively supports both axioms and rules.</p>

  <p>Stardog supports user-defined rule reasoning together with a rich set of built-in functions using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a> syntax and builtin-ins library. In order to apply SWRL user-defined rules, you must include the rules as part of the database's schema: that is, put your rules where your axioms are, i.e., in the schema. See <a href="#tbox_extraction">Schema Extraction</a> for more details. Once the rules are part of the schema, they will be used for reasoning automatically, <em>unless the reasoning level selected is</em> <b>NONE</b>.</p>

<p>Assertions implied by the rules <i>will not</i> be materialized. Instead, rules are used to expand queries just as regular axioms (see <a href="#approach">Stardog's approach to query answering</a>).</p>

<h2>Supported Built-Ins</h2>

<p>Stardog supports the following SWRL built-in functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8.1">Built-ins for comparisons</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8.2">Math built-ins</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8.3">Built-ins for boolean values</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8.4">Built-ins for strings</a>, with the exception of <code>swrlb:tokenize</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8.4">Built-ins for date, time, and duration</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>SWRL Examples</h2>

<p>User-defined rules in SWRL provide a different sort of "user interface" with respect to OWL 2 reasoning in Stardog. Some problems (and some people) are simply a better fit for a rules-based approach to modeling and reasoning than to an axioms-based approach. What follows are a few (trivial and contrived) examples of user-defined rules in SWRL (using Datalog syntax; Stardog requires the canonical RDF serialization of SWRL, however).</p>

<h3>Basic Rules</h3>

<p>A person between 13 and 19 (inclusive) years of age is a teenager:</p>

<pre><code>:Teenager(?x) <- :Person(?x), swrlb:greaterThanOrEqual(?age, 13),
                 swrlb:lessThanOrEqual(?age, 19),
                 :hasAge(?x, ?age)</code></pre>

<p>A person who's an uncle of a niece:</p>

<pre><code>:UncleOfNiece(?x) <- :Person(?x), :Male(?x), :hasSibling(?x, ?y), 
                  :isParentOf(?y, ?z), :Female(?z)</code></pre>

<p>A person who's male and has a niece or nephew is an uncle of his niece(s) and nephew(s):</p>

<pre><code>:isUncleOf(?x, ?z) <- :isSiblingOf(?x, ?y), :isParentOf(?y, ?z), :Male(?x)</code></pre>

<p>A super user can read all of the things!</p>

<pre><code>:Role(?z), :hasRole(?x, ?z), :readPermission(?z, ?y) <- :SuperUser(?x)
                   :Resource(?y), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?z)</code></pre>

<section id="special_predicates"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Special Predicates</h1></header>

<h2>Direct/Strict Subclasses and Subproperties, and Direct Types</h2>

<p>Besides the standard RDF(S) predicates <code>rdf:type</code>, <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> and <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, Stardog supports the following special built-in predicates:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sdle:directType</code></li>
<li><code>sdle:directSubClassOf</code></li>
<li><code>sdle:strictSubClassOf</code></li>
<li><code>sdle:directSubPropertyOf</code></li>
<li><code>sdle:strictSubPropertyOf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where the <code>sdle</code> prefix stands for <code>http://pellet.owldl.com/ns/sdle#</code>.</p>

<p>We define the meaning of these predicates by relating each of them to an analogous triple pattern.<n>The predicates <code>sdle:directSubPropertyOf</code> and <code>sdle:strictSubPropertyOf</code> are defined analogously.</n></p>

<pre><code>:ind sdle:directType :c1 ->

:ind rdf:type :c1 .
FILTER NOT EXISTS {
  :ind rdf:type :c2 .
  :c2 sdle:strictSubClassOf :c1 .
}
</pre></code>

<pre><code>:c1 sdle:strictSubClassOf :c2 ->

:c1 rdfs:subClassOf :c2 .
FILTER NOT EXISTS {
  :c1 owl:equivalentClass :c2 .
}
</pre></code>

<pre><code>:c1 sdle:directSubClassOf :c2 ->

:c1 sdle:strictSubClassOf :c2 .
FILTER NOT EXISTS {
  :c1 sdle:strictSubClassOf :c3 .
  :c3 sdle:strictSubClassOf :c2 .
}
</pre></code>

<p>These triple patterns can be used instead of the triple containing our built-in predicate in SELECT, CONSTRUCT, or ASK queries.</p>

<h2>New Individuals with SWRL</h2>

<p>One cannot create new individuals (i.e., new instances of classes) using SWRL. This restriction is well-motivated as it can lead to non-termination issues. Stardog weakens this restriction in some crucial aspects, subject to the following restrictions, conditions, and warnings. <b>Note that this support is effectively a gun with which users may shoot themselves in the foot if they do not use it carefully.</b></p>

<p>We can create new individuals with a rule by using the (non-standard) built-in predicate <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>:Parent(?y) <- :Person(?x), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?y).</code></pre>

<p>This rule will be used to create a <i>random</i> bnode for each instance of the class <code>:Person</code> and also to assert that each new instance is also an instance of <code>:Parent</code>.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<p>The new individual built-in can <b>only be used in the body of rules and it cannot be the only body atom</b>. The URIs for the generated bnodes are meaningless in the sense that they should not be used in further queries; that is to say, these bnodes are not guaranteed by Stardog to be stable. Due to normalization, rules with more than one atom in the head are broken up into several rules. Thus,</p>

<pre><code>:Male(?y), :Parent(?y) <- :Person(?x), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?y).</code></pre>

<p>will be normalized into:</p>

<pre><code>:Male(?y) <- :Person(?x), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?y).</code></pre>
<pre><code>:Parent(?y) <- :Person(?x), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?y).</code></pre>

<p>As a consequence, in this case, instead of stating that the new individual is both an instance of <code>:Male</code> and <code>:Parent</code>, we would create two <i>different</i> new individuals, and assert that one is male and the other is a parent. If you need to assert various things about the new individual, we recommend the use of extra rules. In the previous example, we can introduce a new class (<code>:Father</code>) and add the following rule to our schema:</p>

<pre><code>:Male(?x), :Parent(?x) <- :Father(?x).</code></pre>

<p>And then modify the original rule accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>:Father(?y) <- :Person(?x), http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql#UUID(?y).</code></pre>

</section>

<section id="approach"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Query Rewriting</h1></header>
   
  <p>Query answering with reasoning in Stardog is based on <i>query rewriting</i>: Stardog rewrites the user's query with respect to the schema, and then executes the resulting expanded query (EQ) against the data. As can be seen in Figure 2, the rewriting process involves 5 different phases.</p>
  
  <div>
   <img src="/docs/owl2/blackout.png" border=0 />
   <p>Figure 1. Query Answering</p>
   <img src="/docs/owl2/blackout-internals.png" border=0 />
   <p>Figure 2. Query Rewriting</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>We illustrate the query answering process by means of an example. Consider a Stardog database, MyDB<sub>1</sub>, containing the following schema axioms:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :SeniorManager rdfs:subClassOf :manages some :Manager
  :manages some :Employee rdfs:subClassOf :Manager
  :Manager rdfs:subClassOf :Employee
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Which says that a senior manager manages at least one manager, that every person that manages an employee is a manager, and that every manager is also an employee. Moreover, let us assume MyDB<sub>1</sub> also contains the following data assertions:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :Bill rdf:type :SeniorManager
  :Robert rdf:type :Manager
  :Ana :manages :Lucy
  :Lucy rdf:type :Employee
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Finally, let us assume that we want to retrieve the set of all employees. We do this by posing the following query:</p>
  
  <pre><code>SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee rdf:type :Employee }</pre></code>
  
  <p>Given the knowledge captured in the schema, we expect all individuals occurring in the data to be part of the answer. In order to answer this query, Stardog first <b>rewrites</b> it using the schema. In this case, the original query is rewritten into four queries:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee rdf:type :Employee }
  SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee rdf:type :Manager }
  SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee rdf:type :SeniorManager }
  SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee :manages ?x. ?x rdf:type :Employee }
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>The final step consists of executing these four queries over the data.</p>
  
  <p>The form of the EQ depends on the reasoning level. For OWL 2 QL, every EQ produced by Stardog <em>is guaranteed to be expanded into a set of queries</em>. If the reasoning level is OWL 2 RL or EL, then the EQ <i>may</i> (but may not) include a recursive rule. If a recursive rule is included, Stardog's answers will be sound but incomplete with respect to the semantics of the requested reasoning level.</p>

 <h2>Why Query Rewriting?</h2>
  
  <p>Query rewriting has several advantages over the (primary) alternative technique, i.e., materialization. In this approach, it is the data that gets expanded with respect to the schema, not the query. That is, the axioms in the schema are used as rules to generate new triples. However, materialization introduces some issues:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>data freshness</b>. Materialization has to be performed every time the data or the schema change. This is particularly unsuitable for applications where the data changes frequently.</li>
  <li><b>data size</b>. Depending on the schema, materialization can significantly increase the size of the data. A relatively simple class hierarchy with a single level of subclasses can duplicate the size of the data.</li>
  <li><b>OWL 2 profile reasoning</b>. Given the fact that QL, RL, and EL, are not comparable with respect to expressive power, an application that requires reasoning with more than one profile would need to maintain different corresponding materialized versions of the data.</li>
  <li><b>Resources</b>. Depending on the size of the original data and the complexity of the schema, materialization can be computationally expensive.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <section id="guidelines"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Performance Hints</h1></header>

  <p>The <a href="#approach">query rewriting approach implemented by Stardog</a> implies guidelines that might contribute to more efficient query answering.</p>

  <h3>Hierarchies and Queries</h3>

  <p><b>Avoid unnecessarily deep class/property hierarchies</b>. If you do not need to model several different types of a given class or property in your schema, then do not. The reason shallow hierarchies are desirable is that the maximal hierarchy depth in the ontology partly determines the maximal size of the EQs produced by Stardog. The larger the EQ, the more difficult is to evaluate it over the data.</p> 
  
  <p>For example, suppose our schema contains a very thorough and detailed set of subclasses of the class <code>:Employee</code>:
  
  <pre><code>
  :Manager rdfs:subClassOf :Employee
  :SeniorManager rdfs:subClassOf :Manager
  ...
  
  :Supervisor rdfs:subClassOf :Employee
  :DepartmentSupervisor rdfs:subClassOf :Supervisor
  ...
  
  :Secretary rdfs:subClassOf :Employee
  ...
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>If we wanted to retrieve the set of all employees, Blackout would produce an EQ containing a query of the following form for every subclass <code>:C<sub>i</sub></code> of <code>:Employee</code>:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?employee WHERE { ?employee rdf:type :C<sub>i</sub> }
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>At this point, it is easy to see that <b>the more specific the query, the better</b> as general queries&mdash;that is, queries that contain concepts high up in the class hierarchy defined by the schema&mdash;as the one above, will typically yield larger EQs.</p>
   
  <h3>Domains and Ranges</h3>
  
  <p><b>Specify domain and range of the properties in the schema</b>. These types of axiom can help reduce the size of the EQs significantly due to an optimization technique implemented in Blackout called <i>query subsumption</i>. In order to grasp the intuition behind it, let us consider the following query asking for people and the employees they manage:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?manager ?employee WHERE { ?manager :manages ?employee. ?employee rdf:type :Employee }
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>We know that this query would cause a large EQ given the deep hierarchy of <code>:Employee</code> in MyDB<sub>1</sub>. However, if we added the following single range axiom:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :manages rdfs:range :Employee
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>then the EQ would collapse to:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?manager ?employee WHERE { ?manager :manages ?employee }
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>which is considerably less difficult to evaluate.</p>
  
</section>

  <h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

  <h3>Databases</h3>
  
  <p>A <i>database</i> (DB), a.k.a. ontology, is composed of two different
parts: the schema or <i>Terminological Box</i> (TBox) and the data or
<i>Assertional Box</i> (ABox). Analogus to relational databases, the
TBox can be thought of as the schema, and the ABox as the data. In other
words, the TBox is a set of <i>axioms</i>, whereas the ABox is a set of
<i>assertions</i>.</p>

<p>As we explain in <a href="#profiles">Section OWL 2 Profiles</a>, the kinds of assertion and axiom that one might use for a particular database are determined by the fragment of OWL 2 to which one would like to adhere.
In general, you should choose the OWL 2 profile that most closely fits the
data modeling needs of your application.</p>

  <p>The most common data assertions are class and property assertions.
  Class assertions are used to state that a particular individual is an
  instance of a given class. Property assertions are used to state that two
  particular individuals (or an individual and a literal) are related via a
  given property. For example, suppose we have a DB MyDB<sub>2</sub>
  that contains the following data assertions:<n>We use the usual standard
  prefixes for RDF(S) and OWL.</n></p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :clark_and_parsia rdf:type :Company
  :clark_and_parsia :maintains :Stardog
  </pre></code> 
  
  <p>stating that <code>:clark_and_parsia</code> is a company, and that
  <code>:clark_and_parsia</code> maintains <code>:Stardog</code>.</p>

<p>The most common schema axioms are subclass axioms. Subclass axioms are
used to state that every instance of a particular class is also an instance
of another class. For example, suppose that MyDB<sub>2</sub> contains
the following TBox axiom:</p>

  <pre><code>
  :Company rdfs:subClassOf :Organization
  </pre></code>

<p>stating that companies are a type of organization.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="query_types">Queries</a></h3>
  
  <p>When reasoning is enabled, Stardog executes SPARQL queries (simply queries from now on) depending on the type of Basic Graph Patterns they contain.</p>
  
  <p>A BGP is said to be an ABox BGP if it is of one of the following forms:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdf:type <b>uri</b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> <b>uri</b> <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:differentFrom <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:sameAs <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A BGP is said to be a TBox BGP if it is of one of the following forms:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdfs:subClassOf <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:disjointWith <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:equivalentClass <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdfs:subPropertyOf <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:equivalentProperty <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:inverseOf <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> owl:propertyDisjointWith <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdfs:domain <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdfs:range <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>A BGP is said to be a Hybrid BGP if it is of one of the following forms:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> rdf:type <b>?var</b></li>
  <li><b>term<sub>1</sub></b> <b>?var</b> <b>term<sub>2</sub></b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>where <b>term</b> (possibly with subscripts) is either an URI or variable; <b>uri</b> is a URI; and <b>?var</b> is a variable.</p>
  
  <p>When executing a query, ABox BGPs are handled by Blackout, TBox BGPs are executed by Pellet, and Hybrid BGPs by a combination of both.</p>
  
  <h3>Reasoning</h3>

  <p>Intuitively, reasoning with a DB means to make implicit knowledge
explicit. There are two main use cases for reasoning: infer implicit
knowledge and discover modeling errors.</p>

  <p>With respect to the first use case, recall that MyDB<sub>2</sub> contains the following assertion and axiom:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :clark_and_parsia rdf:type :Company
  :Company rdfs:subClassOf :Organization
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>From this DB, we can use Stardog in order to <i>infer</i> that <code>:clark_and_parsia</code> is an organization:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :clark_and_parsia rdf:type :Organization
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Using reasoning in order to infer implicit knowledge in the context of an enterprise application can lead to simpler queries. Let us suppose, for example, that MyDB<sub>2</sub> contains a complex class hierarchy including several types of organization (including company). Let us further suppose that our application requires to use Stardog in order to get the list of all considered organizations. If Stardog were used <b>with reasoning</b>, then we would need only issue the following simple query:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?org WHERE { ?org rdf:type :Organization}
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>In contrast, if we were using Stardog <b>with no reasoning</b>, then we would have to issue the following considerably more complex query that considers all possible types of organization:</p>

  <pre><code>
  SELECT ?org WHERE { { ?org rdf:type :Organization } UNION 
                      { ?org rdf:type :Company } UNION
                      ... 
                    }
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Stardog can also be used in order to discover modeling errors in a DB. The most common modeling errors are <i>unsatisfiable</i> classes and <i>inconsistent</i> DBs.</p>
  
  <p>An unsatisfiable class is simply a class that cannot have any instances. Say, for example, that we added the following axioms to MyDB<sub>2</sub>:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  :Company owl:disjointWith :Organization
  :LLC owl:equivalentClass :Company and :Organization  
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>stating that companies cannot be organizations and vice versa, and that an LLC is a company and an organization. The disjointness axiom causes the class <code>:LLC</code> to be unsatisfiable because, for the DB to be contradiction-free, there can be no instances of <code>:LLC</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Asserting (or inferring) that an unsatisfiable class has an instance, causes the DB to be <i>inconsistent</i>. In the particular case of MyDB<sub>2</sub>, we know that <code>:clark_and_parsia</code> is a company AND an organization (see above); therefore, we also know that it is an instance of <code>:LLC</code>, and as <code>:LLC</code> is known to be unsatisfiable, we have that MyDB<sub>2</sub> is inconsistent.</p>
  
  <p>Using reasoning in order to discover modeling errors in the context of an enterprise application is useful in order to maintain a correct contradiction-free model of the domain. In our example, we discovered that <code>:LLC</code> is unsatisfiable and MyDB<sub>2</sub> is inconsistent, which leads us to believe that there is a modeling error in our DB. In this case, it is easy to see that the problem is the disjointness axiom between <code>:Company</code> and <code>:Organization</code>.</p>
  
  <h3 id="profiles">OWL 2 Profiles</h3>
  
  <p>As explained in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Profiles Specification</a> of the W3C, an OWL 2 profile is a trimmed down version of OWL 2 that trades some expressive power for the efficiency of reasoning. There are three OWL 2 profiles, each of which achieves efficiency differently.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_QL">OWL 2 QL</a> is aimed at applications that use very large volumes of instance data, and where query answering is the most important reasoning task. The expressive power of the profile is necessarily limited, however it includes most of the main features of conceptual models such as UML class diagrams and ER diagrams.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_EL">OWL 2 EL</a> is particularly useful in applications employing ontologies that contain very large numbers of properties and/or classes. This profile captures the expressive power used by many such ontologies and is a subset of OWL 2 for which the basic reasoning problems can be performed in time that is polynomial with respect to the size of the ontology.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_RL">OWL 2 RL</a> is aimed at applications that require scalable reasoning without sacrificing too much expressive power. It is designed to accommodate OWL 2 applications that can trade the full expressivity of the language for efficiency, as well as RDF(S) applications that need some added expressivity.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Each profile restricts the kinds of axiom and assertion that can be used in a DB. Intuitively, QL is the least expressive of the profiles, followed by RL and EL; however, strictly speaking, no profile is more expressive than any other as they provide incomparable sets of constructs.</p>
  
  <p>Stardog supports the three profiles of OWL 2 by making use of Blackout and Pellet. Notably, since TBox BGPs are handled completely by Pellet, Stardog supports reasoning for the whole of OWL 2 for queries containing TBox BGPs only.</p>
