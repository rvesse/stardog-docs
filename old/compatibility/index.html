    <p>The Stardog 1.x release ("Stardog" for short) is a major milestone
    in the development of the system. Stardog is a stable platform for the
    growth of projects and programs written for Stardog.</p>

    <p>Stardog provides (and defines) several user-visible things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>SNARL API</li>
      <li>BigPacket Message Format</li>
      <li>Stardog Extended HTTP Protocol</li>
      <li>a command-line interface</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is intended that programs&mdash;as well as SPARQL
queries&mdash;written to Stardog APIs, protocols, and interfaces will
continue to run correctly, unchanged, over the lifetime of Stardog.<n>That
is, over all releases identified by version <tt>1.x</tt>.</n> At some
indefinite point, Stardog 2.0 may be released; but, until that time, Stardog
programs that work today should continue to work even as future releases of
Stardog (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) occur.</p>

  <p>APIs, protocols, and interfaces may grow, acquiring new parts and
  features, but not in a way that breaks existing Stardog programs.</p>

  <h2>Expectations</h2>

    <p>Although we expect that nearly all Stardog programs will
maintain this compatibility over time, it is impossible to guarantee that no
future change will break any program. This document sets expectations for
the compatibility of Stardog programs in the future. The main, foreseeable
reasons for which this compatibility may be broken in the future include:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Security</b>: We reserve the right to break compatibility if
    doing so is required to address a security problem in Stardog.</li>

    <li><b>Unspecified behavior</b>: Programs that depend on unspecified<n>The relevant specs include the Stardog-specific specifications documented on this site, but also W3C (and other) specifications of various languages, including SPARQL, RDF, RDFS, OWL 2, HTTP, Google Protocol Buffers, as well as others.</n>
    behaviors may not work in the future if those behaviors are modified.</li>

    <li><b>3rd Party Specification Errors</b>: It may become necessary to break compatibility of Stardog programs in order to address problems in some 3rd party specification.</li>

    <li><b>Bugs</b>: It will not always be possible to fix bugs found
in Stardog&mdash;or in its 3rd party dependencies&mdash;while also
preserving compatibility. With that proviso, we will endeavor to only break
compatibility when repairing critical bugs.</li>

</ol>

  <p>It is always possible that the performance of a Stardog program may
be (adversely) affected by changes in the implementation of Stardog. No
guarantee can be made about the performance of a given program between
releases, except to say that our expectation is that performance will
generally trend in the appropriate direction.</p>


  <h2>Data Migration &amp; Safety</h2>

  <p>Finally, we expect that data safety will always be given greater weight
than any other consideration. But since Stardog stores user data differently
from the form in which data is input to Stardog, we may from time to time
change the way it is stored such that explicit data migration will be
necessary.</p>

  <p>Stardog provides for two data migration strategies:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Command-line migration tool(s)</li>
    <li>Dump and reload</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We expect that explicit migrations may be required from time to time
between different releases of Stardog 1.0 (that is, 1.1, 1.2, etc.). We will
endeavor to minimize the need for such migrations. We will only require the
"dump and reload" strategy between <em>major</em> releases of Stardog (that
is, from 1.x to 2.x, etc.), unless that strategy of migration is required to
repair a security or other data safety bug in Stardog 1.x.</p>
