    <p>In the <a href="../network/">Network Programming</a> chapter, we
    looked at how to interact with Stardog over a network via HTTP and SNARL protocol.</p>

  <p>In this chapter we describe how to program Stardog from Java using
SNARL ("Stardog Native API for the RDF Language"), Sesame, and Jena. We
prefer SNARL to Sesame to Jena and recommend, all other things being equal,
them in that order.</p>

  <p>If you're a Spring developer, see the <a href="../spring">Programming with Spring</a> chapter.</p>
  

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <p>The <em>best</em> way to learn to program Stardog with Java is to study the examples:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1045573">SNARL</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1045568">Sesame bindings</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1045572">Jena bindings</a></li>

  <p>We offer some commentary on the interesting parts of these examples below.</p>

  <div><span><a id="intro"></a></span></div>

  <section id="admin"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Creating &amp; Administering Databases</h1></header>
	  <p><code>StardogDBMS</code> provides simple programmatic access to all administrative functions available in Stardog.</p>

	  <h2>Creating a Database</h2>
	  <p>You can create a basic temporary memory database with Stardog with one line of code:</p>
	  <div style="font-size:small">
    	<script src="https://gist.github.com/1333782.js?file=CreateTempMemDb.java"></script>
  	  </div>

	  <p>
		  You can also use the <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/StardogDBMS.html#memory()"><code>memory</code></a> and
		  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/StardogDBMS.html#disk()"><code>disk</code></a> functions to configure and create a database in any way you prefer.
		  These methods return <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/DatabaseBuilder.html"><code>DatabaseBuilder</code></a> 
		  objects which you can use to configure the options of the database you'd like to create.  Finally, the
		  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/DatabaseBuilder.html#create()"><code>create</code></a> method
		  takes the list of files to bulk load into the database when you create it.  This returns a valid
		  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html"><code>ConnectionConfiguration</code></a> which
		  can be used to create new <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/Connection.html"><code>Connections</code></a> to your database.</p>

	  <p>
		  It is important to note that, as shown in the example, you <b>must</b> take care to always log out of the server when you are done working with StardogDBMS.
	  </p>

	  <div style="font-size:small">
		  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1333782.js?file=CreateMemSearchDb.java"></script>
	  </div>
	  <p>This illustrates how to create a temporary memory database named 'test' which supports full text search via <a href="../using">Waldo</a>.</p>

	  <div style="font-size:small">
		  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1333782.js?file=CreateDiskAndICV.java"></script>
	  </div>
	  <p>This illustrates how to create a persistent disk database with ICV guard mode enabled at the QL reasoning type.  For more information on what the available
	  options for <code>set</code> are and what they mean, see the refer to the <a href="../admin/">admin docs</a>, specifically the chapter on administing a database.</p>

	  <p>Also note, Stardog database administration can be performed from the <a href="../admin/">command line</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="connection"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Creating a Connection String</h1></header>

  <p>As you can see from all of the examples,
  the <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html"><code>ConnectionConfiguration</code></a> (in <a
href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/package-summary.html"><code>com.clarkparsia.stardog.api</code></a> package) class is
where the initial action takes place:</p>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045578.js?file=L4044.java"></script>
  </div>

<p>The <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html#to()"><code>to()</code></a> method takes a Database Name (as a string);
	and then <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html#connect()"><code>connect()</code></a>
actually connects to the database using all specified properties on the configuration.</p>

<p>This class and its constructor methods are used for <em>all</em> of
Stardog's Java APIs: SNARL (native Stardog API), Sesame, Jena, as well
as HTTP and SNARL protocol. In the latter cases, you must also call <a
href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html#url(java.lang.String)"><code>url()</code></a> and pass it a
valid URL to the Stardog server using the HTTP or SNARL protocols.</p>

<p>Without the call to <code>url()</code>, your ConnectionConfiguration
will attempt to connect to a local, embedded version of the Stardog server.
The Connection still operates in the standard client-server mode, the only
difference is that the server is running in the <i>same</i> JVM as your
application.  You can use the convenience methods on StardogDBMS to start and
stop the embedded server.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Whether using SNARL, Sesame, or Jena, most (perhaps all)
Stardog Java code will use <code>ConnectionConfiguration</code> to get a
handle on a Stardog database&mdash;whether embedded or remote&mdash;and,
after getting that handle, can use the API that makes the most sense for the
use cases and requirements at hand.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/ConnectionConfiguration.html"><code>ConnectionConfiguration</code></a>
API docs or the <a href="../admin/">administration section</a> for more information on connection strings.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="security"><header><h1 id="chapter">Security in Stardog</h1></header>

  <p>We extensively discuss the security sytem in Stardog in the <a href="../security">security</a> section.</p>

  <p>When logged into a <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/StardogDBMS.html">StardogDBMS</a> you can access all security related features detailed in the
  security section using any of the core security interfaces for <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/security/UserManager.html">managing users</a>,
	  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/security/RoleManager.html">roles</a> and <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/security/PermissionManager.html">permissions</a></p>

	  <p><a href="http://shiro.apache.org">Shiro</a> is used internally as the core of the security framework,
		  but unlike previous versions, you do not need to configure Shiro directly.  All management can be done via the command-line
	  or via the security API provided by StardogDBMS</p>

  </section>

  <section id="snarl"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Using SNARL</h1></header>

  <p>
	  In the examples (1) and (4) above, you can see how to use SNARL in
	  Java to interact with Stardog. The SNARL API will give the best performance
	  overall and is the native Stardog API. It uses some Sesame domain classes
	  but is otherwise a clean-sheet API and set of implementations.</p>

	  <p>The SNARL API is fluent with the aim of
		  making code written for Stardog easier to write and easier to maintain.
		  Most objects are easily re-used to make basic tasks with SNARL as simple as possible.
		  We are always interested in feedback on the API, so if you have suggestions or comments, please
		  send them to the mailing list.</p>

  <p>Let's take a closer look at some of the interesting parts of SNARL.</p>

  <h2>Adding Data</h2>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045573.js?file=SNARLAddData.java"></script>
  </div>

	  <p>You must always surround changes to
		  a database with a transaction begin and commit.  Changes are kept locally until
		  the transaction is committed, or you try and perform a query operation to inspect
		  the state of the database within the transaction.</p>

	  <p>By default, RDF added will go into the default context unless specified otherwise.  As shown, you can use
		  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/Adder.html">Adder</a> directly to add statements and graphs to the database,
		  and if you want to add data from a file or input stream, you use an <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/IO.html"><code>io()</code></a>,
		  <code>format()</code>, and <code>stream()</code> chain of method invocations.</p>

	  <p>See the <a href="../java/snarl">SNARL API</a> Javadocs for all the
		  gory details.</p>

  <h2>Getter Interface</h2>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045573.js?file=SNARLGetter.java"></script>
  </div>

  <p>SNARL also supports some sugar for the classic statement-level
  (<code>getSPO()</code> scars, anyone?) interactions. We ask in the first
  line of the snippet above for an iterator over the Stardog connection,
  based on <code>aURI</code> in the subject position. Then a while-loop, as
  one might expect...</p>

  <p>You can also parameterize <code>Getter</code>s by binding different
positions of the <code>Getter</code> (which acts like a kind of RDF
statement filter)&mdash;and the iterating as usual.</p>
  
  <p><b>Note</b> the <code>aIter.close()</code> which is important for
Stardog databases to avoid memory leaks.</p>

  <p>If you need to materialize the iterator as a graph, you can do that by
  calling <code>graph()</code>.</p>

  <p>The snippet doesn't show <code>object()</code> or <code>context()</code>
parameters on a <code>Getter</code>, but those work, too, in the obvious
way.</p>

  <h2>Parameterized SPARQL Queries</h2>

  <p>SNARL also lets us parameterize SPARQL queries.</p>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045573.js?file=SNARLQuery.java"></script>
  </div>

  <p>We can make a <code>Query</code> object by passing a SPARQL query in the constructor. Simple. Obvious.</p>

  <p>Next, let's set a limit for the results: <code>aQuery.limit(10)</code>;
  or if we want no limit, <code>aQuery.limit(Query.NO_LIMIT)</code>.  By default, there is no limit imposed on the query object; we'll use whatever is specified in the query.
  But you can use limit to override any limit specified in the query, however specifying NO_LIMIT will not remove a limit specified in a query, it will only remove
  any limit override you've specified restoring the state to the default of using whatever is in the query.</p>

  <p>We can execute that query with <code>executeSelect()</code> and
iterate over the results. We can also rebind the "?s" variable easily:
<code>aQuery.parameter("s", aURI)</code>, which will work for all instances
of "?s" in any BGP in the query, and you can specify <code>null</code> to remove the binding.</p>

	  <p>Query objects are re-useable, so you can create one from your original query string
	  and alter bindings, limit, and offset in any way you see fit and re-execute the query
	  to get the updated results.</p>

  <p>We <b>strongly</b> recommend the use of SNARL's parameterized queries over concatenating strings together in order to build your SPARQL query.  This latter
      approach opens up the possibility for SPARQL injection attacks unless you are very careful in scrubbing your input.</p>

  <h2>Removing Data</h2>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045573.js?file=SNARLRemoveData.java"></script>
  </div>

  <p>Let's look at <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/Remover.html">removing</a> data via SNARL;
	  in the example above, you can
	  see that file or stream-based removal is symmetric to file or stream-based
	  addition, i.e., calling <code>remove()</code> in an <code>io()</code> chain
	  with a file or stream call. See the SNARL API docs for more details about
	  finer-grained deletes, etc.</p>

  <h2>Reasoning</h2>

	  <p>Stardog supports query time OWL 2 QL, EL, and RL
		  reasoning by using a query rewriting technique.<n>In short, when reasoning
			  is requested, a query is automatically rewritten in <i>n</i> queries, which
			  are then executed.</n>. As we discuss below in Connection Pooling, reasoning
		  is enabled at the <code>Connection</code> layer and then any queries
		  executed over that connection are executed with reasoning enabled;
		  you don't need to do anything up front when you create your database if you want to use reasoning.</p>

  <div style="font-size:small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045578.js?file=CreateReasoningConn.java"></script>
  </div>

  <p>In this code example, you can see that it's trivial to enable reasoning
for a <code>Connection</code>: simply call <code>reasoning()</code> with
the appropriate constant (such as <code>ReasoningType.QL</code>) passed in. In
  addition to OWL2 QL, EL, and RL, Stardog supports OWL2 DL <i>schema</i> queries.  Stardog also supports <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a>.</p>

	  <p>For more information on how reasoning is supported in Stardog, check out the
	  <a href="../owl2">reasoning section</a>.</p>
<h2>Search</h2>

<p>We introduced a <a href="../using">search</a> system into Stardog
<b>0.6.5</b>; it can be used from the command line or remotely over the
network interface. It can also be used from Java in the following way.</p>

<div style="font-size: small">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1085116.js?file=SearcherUsage.java"></script>
</div>

<p>The fluent Java API for searching in SNARL looks a lot like the other
search interfaces: We create a <code>Searcher</code> instance with a
fluent constructor: <code>limit()</code> sets a limit on the results;
<code>query()</code> contains the search query, and <code>threshold</code>
sets a minimum threshold for the results.
</p>

<p>Then we call the <code>search()</code> method of our
<code>Searcher</code> instance and iterate over the results
(i.e., <code>SearchResults</code>). Last, we can use
<code>offset()</code> on an existing <code>Searcher</code> to grab another
page of results.</p>

<p>Stardog also supports performing searches over the full-text index <i>within</i> a SPARQL query via the <a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/larq/">LARQ SPARQL syntax</a>.
This provides a powerful mechanism for querying both your RDF index and full-text index at the same time while also giving you a more performant option to the SPARQL <code>regex</code> filter.</p>

  <h2>SNARL Connection Views</h2>

	  <p>
		  As of 0.7, SNARL <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/Connection.html#"><code>Connections</code></a>
		  support obtaining a specified type of Connection.  This provides the ability to extend
		  and enhance the features available to a Connection while maintaining the standard,
		  simple Connection API.  The Connection <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/Connection.html#as()"><code>as</code></a> method takes
		  as a parameter the interface, which must be a sub-type of a Connection, that you
		  would like to use.  <code>as</code> will either return the Connection as the view
		  you've specified, or it will throw an exception if the view could not be obtained
		  for some reason.
	  </p>

	  <div style="font-size:small">
		  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1085116.js?file=SearchConnectionView.java"></script>
	  </div>

	  <p>
		  An example of obtaining an instance of a
		  <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/api/search/SearchConnection.html"><code>SearchConnection</code></a>

	  </p>

  <h2>SNARL API Docs</h2>

  <p>Please see <a href="../java/snarl/">SNARL API</a> docs for more
information.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sesame"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Using Sesame</h1></header>

  <p>Stardog supports the <a
href="http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch07.html">Sesame API</a>;
thus, for the most part, using Stardog and Sesame is not much different from
using Sesame with other RDF databases. There are, however, at least two
differences worth pointing out. <p>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045568.js?file=init.java"></script>
  </div>

  <h2>Wrap the connection with <code>StardogRepository</code></h2>

  <p>As you can see from the code snippet, once you've created a <code>ConnectionConfiguration</code>
  with all the details for connecting to a Stardog database, you can wrap that in a <code>StardogRepository</code>
  which is a Stardog specific implementation of the Sesame <code>Repository</code> interface.  At this
  point, you can use the resulting Repository like any other Sesame Repository implementation.  Each time
  you call <code>Repository.getConnection</code>, your original ConnectionConfiguration will be used
  to spawn a new connection to the database.</p>	  

  <h2>Autocommit</h2>

  <p>Stardog's RepositoryConnection implementation will, by default, disable <code>autoCommit</code> status.
     When enabled, every single statement added or deleted via the Connection will incur the cost
     of a transaction, which is too heavyweight for nearly every use case.  You can enable <code>autoCommit</code>
     and it will work as expected, but for the aforementioned reason, and the fact that Sesame has deprecated
     the method, we recommend leaving it disabled.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="jena"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Using Jena</h1></header>

  <p>Stardog supports Jena via a Sesame-Jena bridge, so it's got more
  overhead than Sesame or SNARL. YMMV. There two points in the Jena example
  to re-iterate.</p>

  <h2>Init in Jena</h2>

   <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045572.js?file=InitJena.java"></script>
  </div>


    <p>The initialization in Jena is a bit different from either
    SNARL or Sesame; you can get a Jena <code>Model</code> instance
    by passing the <code>Connection</code> instance (returned by
    <code>ConnectionConfiguration</code>) to the Stardog factory,
    <code>SDJenaFactory</code>.</p>

    <h2>Add in Jena</h2>
   
    <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1045572.js?file=AddToJena.java"></script>
  </div>

    <p>Jena also wants to add data to a <code>Model</code> one statement
at a time, which can be less than ideal. To work around this restriction,
we recommend adding data to a <code>Model</code> in a single Stardog
transaction, which is initiated with <code>aModel.begin()</code>.
Then to read data into the model, we recommend using RDF/XML, since
that triggers the <code>BulkUpdateHandler</code> in Jena or grab a
<code>BulkUpdateHandler</code> directly from the underlying Jena graph.</p>

  <p>The other options include using the Stardog <a
href="../admin/#cli">command-line</a> client to bulk load a Stardog
database or to use SNARL for loading and then switch to Jena for other
operations, processing, query, etc.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="client-server"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Client-Server Stardog</h1></header>

  <p>As you can see, using Stardog from Java in either embedded
or client-server mode is <em>very similar</em>&mdash;the only
really visible difference is the use of <code>url()</code> in a
<code>ConnectionConfiguration</code>: when it's present, we're in
client-server model; else, we're in embedded mode.</p>

  <p>That's a good and a bad thing: it's good because the code is symmetric
and uniform. It's bad because it can make reasoning about performance
difficult, i.e., it's not entirely clear in client-server mode which
operations trigger (or don't trigger) a round trip with the server and, thus,
which may be more expensive than in embedded mode.</p>

<p>In client-server mode, <em>everything triggers a round trip</em> with these exceptions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>closing a connection outside a transaction</li>
    <li>any parameterizations (or other) of a query or getter instance</li>
    <li>any database state mutations in a transaction that don't need to be immediately visible to the transaction; that is, changes are sent to the server only when they are
	required, on commit, or on any query or read operation that needs to have the accurate up-to-date state of the data within the transaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Stardog generally tries to be as lazy as possible; but in client-server
mode, since state is maintained on the client, there are fewer chances to be
lazy and more interactions with the server.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="embed"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Embedded Stardog</h1></header>

  <p>In addition to the <code>url()</code> issue, the other key difference
  between client-server and embedded Stardog is, of course, Java classpath
  woes. As of <b>@@VERSION@@</b>, there is one classpath issues to watch
  out for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>if you're using Jena in embedded mode, then Jena's libraries should be on the classpath <em>after</em> Stardog's, because of conflicting Lucene JARs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let us know if you find any other conflicts among JARs or other classpath issues.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="pool"><header><h1 id='chapter'>Connection Pooling</h1></header>

  <p>Stardog supports connection pools for SNARL <code>Connection</code>
objects for efficiency and programmer sanity. Here's how they work:</p>

  <div style="font-size: small">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1070230.js?file=JustCode.java"></script>
  </div>

  <p>Per standard practice, we first initialize security and grab a
  connection, in this case to the <tt>testConnectionPool</tt> database.</p>

  <p>Then we setup a <code>ConnectionPoolConfig</code>, using its fluent
  API, which establishes the parameters of the pool:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>using()</dt>
    <dd>Sets which ConnectionConfiguration we want to pool; this is what is used to actually create the connections.</dd>
    <dt>minPool()</dt>
    <dt>maxPool()</dt>
    <dd>Establishes min and max pooled objects; max pooled objects includes both leased and idled objects.</dd>
    <dt>expiration()</dt>
    <dd>Sets the idle life of objects; in this case, the pool reclaims objects idled for 1 hour.</dd>
    <dt>blockAtCapacity()</dt>
    <dd>Sets the max time (here: in minutes) that we'll block waiting for an object when there aren't any idle ones in the pool.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Whew! Next we can <connect>create()</connect> the pool using this <code>ConnectionPoolConfig</code> thing.</p>

  <p>Finally, we call <code>obtain()</code> on the
<code>ConnectionPool</code> when we need a new one. And when we're done
with it, we return it to the pool so it can be re-used, by calling
<code>release()</code>. When we're done, we <code>shutdown()</code> the
pool.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../owl2">reasoning</a> in Stardog is enabled per
<code>Connection</code>, you can create two pools: one with reasoning
connections, one with non-reasoning connections; and then use the one you
need to have reasoning <em>per query</em>; never pay for
more than you need.</p>

  </section>
